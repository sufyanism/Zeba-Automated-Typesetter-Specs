# 🖨️ Zeba Type-Setter
**Zeba Type-Setter** is a specialized automation tool designed to transform raw manuscripts into print-ready PDFs. By leveraging the power of **Typst**, it provides a modern, fast, and high-precision alternative to traditional typesetting tools like LaTeX or Adobe InDesign.

This project is part of the Zeba publishing suite, aimed at simplifying the technical workflow for authors and independent publishers.

## 🚀 Features
* **DOCX to PDF**: Seamlessly convert Microsoft Word manuscripts into professional book layouts.
* **Typst Engine**: Built on the ultra-fast Typst compiler for near-instant PDF generation.
* **Auto-Sanitization**: Automatically escapes special characters (`#`, `$`, `@`, `_`) to ensure smooth compilation.
* **Integrated Metadata**: (Optional) Pairs with the Zeba Metadata Forge to ensure your book's interior matches its digital identifiers.
* **Web-Ready Interface**: Powered by Streamlit for a clean, browser-based drag-and-drop experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language**: Python 3.10+
* **UI Framework**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
* **Document Parsing**: `python-docx`
* **Typesetting Engine**: [Typst](https://typst.app/) (via `typst-bin`)
